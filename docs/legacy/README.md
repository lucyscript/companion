# Legacy Documentation

This folder contains documentation from the **agent-orchestrated development phase** of Companion — a recursive self-improvement experiment where AI coding agents built the app autonomously via GitHub issues and PRs.

## Contents

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **agents/** | `.agents/` config files — CLAUDE.md, CODEX.md, COPILOT.md, orchestration, task board |
| **github-agents/** | `.github/agents/` role profiles — backend, frontend, docs, test engineer |
| **github-config/** | PR templates, issue templates, orchestrator scripts |
| **project-brief.md** | Original 420-line project brief with phase roadmap |
| **contracts.md** | API payload shape contracts (1292 lines) |
| **api.md** | Earlier API documentation |
| **agent-prompt.md** | System prompt for agent sessions |
| **task-template.md** | Issue template structure for agent tasks |
| **github-content-agent-design.md** | Design doc for GitHub content integration agent |
| **dev-environment.md** | Original dev setup instructions |
| **deadline-notification-actions.md** | Deadline notification action design |
| **onboarding-video-roadmap.md** | Video onboarding feature planning |

## Why keep this?

The agent workflow methodology (orchestrator → issue creation → agent assignment → auto-merge) is reusable for future projects. These docs capture the patterns, prompts, and automation that made it work.

## Status

**Not maintained.** These docs may reference outdated code, single-tenant assumptions, or features that have changed. For current documentation, see the parent [`docs/` folder](../README.md).
